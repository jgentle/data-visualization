### Presentation Controls

Navigate the slide show with these controls:

  * left & right arrows to move through slides horizontally.
  * up & down arrows to drill into slide columns.
  * escape key to see all slides (then arrows to nav to a specific slide)
    * These configs can be overridden if desired.
  * use s to enter speaker view mode in another window.
  * use b to pause and blackout the presentation.
  * select "View > Enter Full Screen" in your browser menu for the best fullscreen performance.
  * you can also use f to enter fullscreen, esc to exit fullscreen - but there is a bug in the background color styles that may bork the presentation design.

### Printing the Presentation to PDF

The presentation can be converted to print ready format by running it as usual then opening a customized version of the URL in your browser and following the usual CTRL/CMD+P conventions for printing to PDF or paper.

*Note that the presentation will look garbled on the screen but will be correct in the print preview and in the PDF/files produced by the print process.*

1) grunt serve

1) Append *?print-pdf* to the end of the url like so:
    ```
    http://localhost:9000/?print-pdf
    ```
1) CTRL/CMD+P to open the print dialog window.

1) Print as desired.
