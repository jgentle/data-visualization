##  Data Visualization

_**Data Visualization**_ is the presentation of data in a visualization format.

It is often considered the modern analog of *Visual Communication*.

Data is the raw material of information. It is the product of research and discovery.

A single piece of data has no meaning unless the context is understood.

Data needs to be *transformed* into information.

<!-- This implies that not all data visualizations are based on information, but all information visualizations are data visualizations (and hence that not all information visualizations facilitate knowledge transfer but all knowledge visualizations are information visualizations). -->

<!-- In order to formulate knowledge (a set of rules and principles) on a subject, there must be some form of intelligence that is capable of learning (identifying patterns in information which is then used to define new rules and principles) and then applying said knowledge. This role is often carried out by the users of a visualization, but could also be filled by an *Artificial Intelligence* (AI) utilizing *Machine Learning* (ML) to monitor, analyze, report and administer real-time flows of data through a data pipeline. -->

> Individual bits or "bytes" of "raw" biological data (e.g. the number of individual plants of a given species at a given location) do not by themselves inform the human mind. However, drawing various data together within an appropriate context yields information that may be useful (e.g. the distribution and abundance of the plant species at various points in space and time). In turn, this information helps foster the quality of knowing (e.g. whether the plant species is increasing or decreasing in distribution and abundance over space and time). Knowledge and experience blend to become wisdom--the power of applying these attributes critically or practically to make decisions.
