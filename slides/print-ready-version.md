##  Printing this Presentation

Printing functionality requires the presentation to be running on a web server (either locally or online).

You can then print this presentation by appending ```?print-pdf```  to the end of the URL:
```
# localhost.
http://localhost:9000/?pdf-print/

# live online.
http://mydomain.com/my-presentation/?pdf-print/
```

Follow it then enter the standard CTRL/CMD+P (or use browser menu > Print...).

_**The content will look weird until you print preview... but it will print OKAY!**_

For convenience I have included the localhost link below.

[Print Ready Version](http://localhost:9000/?print-pdf/)<!-- .element: target="_blank" data-preview-link -->
