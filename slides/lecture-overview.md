##  Overview

_**Visualization**_ is the representation of an object, situation, or set of information as a chart or other image.

Visualization has applications in science, education, engineering, interactive multimedia, medicine, etc. Typical of a visualization application is the field of computer graphics.

**The invention of computer graphics may be the most important development in visualization since the invention of central perspective in the Renaissance period.**

Visualizations are broadly classified into three basic categories:
* Static - display information in an unchanging format and requires no user input.
* Dynamic - display information in a changing state (e.g. motion graphics) but requires no user input.
* Interactive - displays information in a static or dynamic state but will change based on user input.
