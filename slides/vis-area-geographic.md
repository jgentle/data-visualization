##  Geographic Visualization

_**Geographic Visualization**_ (a.k.a. *Geovisualization*) refers to a set of tools and techniques supporting the analysis of geospatial data through the use of interactive visualization. Geovisualization emphasizes knowledge construction over knowledge storage or information transmission by communicating geospatial information in ways that (when combined with human understanding) allow for data exploration and decision-making processes.
