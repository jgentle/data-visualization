##  Types of Visualizations

_**Data Visualization**_ is the presentation of data in a visualization format.

_**Information Visualization**_ is the study of visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition.

_**Scientific Visualization**_ is primarily concerned with the visualization of three-dimensional phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, biological, etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component. The purpose of scientific visualization is to graphically illustrate scientific data to enable scientists to understand, illustrate, and glean insight from their data.

_**Geographic Visualization**_ (a.k.a. *Geovisualization*) refers to a set of tools and techniques supporting the analysis of geospatial data through the use of interactive visualization. Geovisualization emphasizes knowledge construction over knowledge storage or information transmission by communicating geospatial information in ways that (when combined with human understanding) allow for data exploration and decision-making processes.
