##  Areas of Visualizations

_**Data Visualization**_ is the presentation of data in a visualization format. It is often considered the modern analog of *visual communication*.

_**Information Visualization**_ is the study of visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition and derive new insights.

_**Knowledge Visualization**_ is the use of visual representations to improve the transfer of knowledge by using computer and non-computer-based visualization methods complementarily, focusing on transferring insights and creating new knowledge in groups.

_**Educational Visualization**_ is using a simulation, usually created on a computer, to create an image of something so it can be taught about (ex. atomic structure).

_**Product Visualization**_ is the viewing and manipulation of 3D models, technical drawing and other related documentation of manufactured components and large assemblies of products.

_**Scientific Visualization**_ is primarily concerned with the visualization of three-dimensional phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, biological, etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component. The purpose of scientific visualization is to graphically illustrate scientific data to enable scientists to understand, illustrate, and glean insight from their data.

_**Geographic Visualization**_ (a.k.a. *Geovisualization*) refers to a set of tools and techniques supporting the analysis of geospatial data through the use of interactive visualization. Geovisualization emphasizes knowledge construction over knowledge storage or information transmission by communicating geospatial information in ways that (when combined with human understanding) allow for data exploration and decision-making processes.
