##  Areas of Visualization

Data visualization can be divided into several broad areas:
* Data Visualization
* Information Visualization
* Knowledge Visualization
* Educational Visualization
* Product Visualization
* Scientific Visualization
* Geographic Visualization

The first three areas are roughly ordered according to the *data-information-knowledge cycle* whereby data is structured and organized into information, information is structured and organized into knowledge and knowledge is used to make an informed decision (based on contextualized data).

The distinctions between the subsequent areas of educational, product, scientific and geographic visualizations are derived from their intended use and the spatial reference constraints inherent in them.
