##  Areas of Visualization

Data visualization can be divided into several broad areas:
* Information Visualization
* Data Visualization
* Knowledge Visualization
* Educational Visualization
* Product Visualization
* Scientific Visualization
* Geographic Visualization

These are roughly ordered according to the *data-information-knowledge cycle* whereby data is structured and organized into information, information is structured and organized into knowledge and knowledge is used to make an informed decision (based on contextualized data).

This implies that not all information visualizations are based on data, but all data visualizations are information visualizations (and that not all data visualizations facilitate knowledge transfer but all knowledge visualizations are data visualizations).

Regarding the remaining areas (educational, product, scientific, geographic) the distinctions between these visualizations manifests more in their intended use and the spatial reference constraints placed upon them than in any hierarchical codification of information.
