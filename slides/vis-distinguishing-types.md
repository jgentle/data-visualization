##  Distinguishing Visualization Types

Apart from the categorization between static, dynamic and interactive visualizations, the next useful distinction is between the types of visualization: abstract and model-based.

**Abstract** visualizations show completely conceptual constructs in 2D or 3D. These generated shapes are completely arbitrary.

**Model-based** visualizations either place overlays of data on real or digitally constructed images of reality or make a digital construction of a real object directly from the scientific data.
