##  Distinguishing Visualization Types

Apart from the distinction between interactive visualizations and animation, the most useful categorization is between abstract and model-based scientific visualizations.

The abstract visualizations show completely conceptual constructs in 2D or 3D. These generated shapes are completely arbitrary. The model-based visualizations either place overlays of data on real or digitally constructed images of reality or make a digital construction of a real object directly from the scientific data.

When the spatial representation is chosen it is an *Information Visualization*.

When the spatial representation is given it is a *Scientific Visualization*.

When the spatial representation is given *and* said representation is based on geographical information it is a *Geospatial Visualization*.
