##  Spatial Representation

Another way to think of the two visualization types (abstract vs. model-based) is in terms of their *Spatial Representation*.

The representational constraints required by the visualization will often indicate the area of visualization that would be most appropriate to communicate the findings.

<!--
When the spatial representation is chosen by the researcher it is generally going to be a *Data Visualization*, *Information Visualization* or a *Knowledge Visualization*.

When the spatial representation is given to the researcher it is generally going to be a *Product Visualization*, *Educational Visualization* or a *Scientific Visualization*.

When the spatial representation is given to the researcher *and* said representation is based on geographical information it is generally going to be a *Geospatial Visualization*.

*Spatial Representation Constraints* | *Visualization Area*
---|---
Researchers Choice (Any) | *Data Visualization*, *Information Visualization*, *Knowledge Visualization*
Supplied (2D, 3D) | *Product Visualization*, *Educational Visualization*, *Scientific Visualization*
Supplied (GIS) | *Geospatial Visualization*
