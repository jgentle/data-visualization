##  Spatial Representation

Another way to think of the two visualization types (abstract vs. model-based) is in terms of their *Spatial Representation*.

When the spatial representation is chosen by the researcher it is usually an *Information Visualization*.

When the spatial representation is given to the researcher it is usually a *Scientific Visualization*.

When the spatial representation is given to the researcher *and* said representation is based on geographical information it is usually a *Geospatial Visualization*.
