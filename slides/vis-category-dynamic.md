Cl- + CH3I- -> ClCH3 + I- SN2 Reaction Dynamics. Both direct [left] and indirect [right] reaction mechanisms are observed in the trajectories. The direct reaction occurs via the traditional SN2 mechanism with Cl- colliding backside with direct displacement of I- . The indirect reaction occurs via a CH3 rotation, roundabout mechanism in which Cl- strikes the CH3-moiety causing it to rotate around the I-atom and Cl- displacing I- after one CH3 revolution with the backside of the CH3-moiety positioned next to Cl-.
